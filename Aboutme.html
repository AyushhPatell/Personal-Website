              Sundar Pichai is also know as Pichai Sundararajan, he is the Chief Executive officer (CEO) of Company Google and Alphabet. His work and story really motivates me, he borned in a small village called Madurai in India. He completed his degree from IIT Kharagpur. I really appreciate his hard-work he did to achieve one of the best position in the world from nothing. His Journey to Google started when he moved to United States and joined Google in 2004.

              His full name is Ratan Naval Tata and he is one of the most Successful Indian Businessman. He is truly inspiration for me. Inspite of being one of the biggest Businessman, his atitude is down to earth. He speaks and behave very politely to everyone and he is a very humble guy. Under the leadership of Ratan Tata, Tata Group Company has done very well and made a good growth. He is a reason of my motivation because he is very active and hard-working also at the age of 85. Ratan Tata is also considered a leading philanthropist in India as he is a great supporter of Education and Development. Ratan Tata also runs many Charity Events.
